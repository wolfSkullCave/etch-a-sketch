2) Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
    - use js
    - build squares inside a div container
    - use flexbox to make the inner div squares display as a grid
    - be careful of borders and margins

3) Add a hover effect to the divs to change the color.
    - add a new class 
    - change the class of the div to the new class on click event

4) Create a button to change the grid size.
    - set a fixed size (width and height) for the grid container
    - move the grid creation to a function
